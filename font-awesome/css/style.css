/*
  Font Awesome styles related to the embedded image implementation.

  Because SVGs are large by default, it's necessary to re-size these in
  CSS. You would never do this with raster images. But it is okay to do
  with vector images since these are usually small in file size and are
  designed to be re-sized with 'math.'

  The following rule uses an attribute selector in CSS. This will
  target any tag which has a 'src' attribute which ends with '.svg'.
  When the width is set to a fixed width, set the height to auto to
  assure the image is not distorted when re-sized.
