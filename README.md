The following repository may be updated with more content as they are presented in class. Check back often for new examples.

## A note about styles

In many cases, these examples have styles added using the `<style>` tag inside HTML. This is done for the sake of simplicity in presenting these creative examples.

It is **not** necessary to embed the styles in HTML in order for them to work. If you work with any of these ideas in your own projects, make sure the styles are included via **an external style sheet!**
